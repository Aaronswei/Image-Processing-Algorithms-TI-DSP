			IMAGE PROCESSING USING DSP
_____________________________________________________________________
Folders 0-10 contain various Image Processing technique Implementation

Each Folder contains a Code_Flow.txt(same for all) and Theory.txt
Read the txt files to understand the basics of that Image processing technique and the corresponding code flow.

To obtain output:
0) START
1) Open CCSv4
2) Import Existing CCS/CCE Project
3) Select the path of the folder and the .pjt file in it
4) Buil-> Debug-> Run
5) Open the VC0703_Camera.py file in the same folder 
(Right Click-> Edite with IDLE)
6) Check COM PORT(Device Manager) if not same as PORT change PORT in VC0703_Camera.py file.
 
7) Run
8) Output related to the PC_Image.jpg file will appear in the same directory in which the VC0703_Camera.py file is saved
9) Final Console print will be "Well Done"
10) Close Python
11) Terminate CCSv4 Debug
12) STOP

Theory contains PPT Lectures on Image Processing by Prof. K.T. Talele, Sardar Patel Institute of Technology

These were used as reference in making code and understanding the Image Processing Techniques in a better way
